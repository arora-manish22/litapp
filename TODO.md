App development is currently dead because it does not build anymore:
```
Module build failed: Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open 'C:\github\illuminatus\litapp\src\app\main.js'

# IDEAS
 - Split story pages so no vertical scrolling occurs?
 - Hide tabs and search bar when scrolling on search page?
 - Find api route for story comments
 - Find better api route for getting author following status together with bio
 - Find better api route to get more story metadata for improved story refresh

# BUGS
 - Fix rating sometimes shows as x.xx
 - Don't refresh history when viewing downloads

## Also check TODOs in files!
