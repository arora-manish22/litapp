# TODO
 - Show loading indicator when lists are still loading at app start

# IDEAS
 - Split story pages so no vertical scrolling occurs?
 - Hide tabs and search bar when scrolling on search page?
 - Find api route for story comments
 - Find better api route for getting author following status together with bio
 - Find better api route to get more story metadata (especially 'new' badge) for improved story refresh
 - Find api route to get all categories

# BUGS
 - Fix rating sometimes shows as x.xx
 - Don't refresh history when viewing downloads
 - List story count != item count (problem in api itself)
 - (un)Follow doesn't work server side + correctly catch success?
