# MISSING DATA

- Find api route to get all categories (old was removed)
- Find api route for story comments
- Find better api route for getting author following status together with bio
- Find better api route to get more story metadata (especially 'new' badge) for improved story refresh

# TODO

- Add (unrelated) backup function for backing up your literotica lists and followed authors (json & markdown?)

# BUGS

- Fix rating sometimes shows as x.xx
- (Un)follow doesn't seem to work server side + correctly catch success?
- List story count != item count (problem server side)
- Don't refresh history when viewing downloads (?)

## Also check TODOs in files
