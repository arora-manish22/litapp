- Find API route for story comments
- Find better API route for getting author following status together with bio
- Find better API route to get more story metadata (especially 'new' badge) for improved story refresh

# TODO

- WebApp: Add links to homepage
- WebApp: Deploy proxy (Heroku?) & update webapp build script + document flow
- Button to download whole series at once
- Include stack trace in exported log file
