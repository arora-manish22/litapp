# MISSING DATA

- Find API route to get all categories (old was removed)
- Find API route for story comments
- Find better API route for getting author following status together with bio
- Find better API route to get more story metadata (especially 'new' badge) for improved story refresh

# TODO

- WebApp: Stub native packages (download files instead of saving, google analytics... -> see app.module.ts)
- WebApp: Add links to homepage
- Auto update version number and build deploy script (GitHub action on tag?)

# BUGS

## Not reproducible

- List story count != item count (problem server side)
- Fix rating sometimes shows as x.xx (?)
- Downloaded stories disappearing without internet connection?
- Downloading stories to file doesn't always work (ENCODING_ERR?)

> Also check TODOs in files!
