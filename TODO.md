# MISSING DATA

- Find api route to get all categories (old was removed)
- Find api route for story comments
- Find better api route for getting author following status together with bio
- Find better api route to get more story metadata (especially 'new' badge) for improved story refresh

# TODO

- Setting to cache lists
- amoled dark mode? (no clue how, manually override all compiled css? multiple main.css files?)

# BUGS

- Fix rating sometimes shows as x.xx (?)
- List story count != item count (problem server side) (?)
- Don't refresh history when viewing downloads (?)

## Also check TODOs in files
